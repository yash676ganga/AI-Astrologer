# AI-Astrologer
AI astrologer is designed to generate personalized astrological reports using the Kerykeion library, which provides astrological data for individuals based on their birth details then utilizing Google's LLM Gemini for chat-based predictive conversation.  

Project Description
This project combines two key elements:

Kerykeion Library: Leverages the Kerykeion library to access and process astrological data based on an individual's birth information.
Google's LLM Gemini: Employs the capabilities of Google's large language model, Gemini, to conduct chat-based conversations focused on astrological predictions.
By integrating these aspects, AI-Astrologer aims to deliver a unique user experience that blends traditional astrology with the power of AI-driven conversation.
